1. fixing landing page. Intro for the player.
2. live meters: Cred and pop. add tooltips. (shouldn't be gauge, we need totals)
3. fix a lot of images
4. image selections (maximum selection options)
5. text search: show additional info (scroll rect)
6. make text selector like the image selector
7. add image subtext (more cryptic clues, not so obvious)



Practise lateral reading on text: Scroll past the top/most affective hits, open multiple sources in parallel, prioritise official/local outlets, and corroborate before deciding.
Practise lateral reading on images: Use reverse image search to recover original date, place, and context, spot reused and manipulated media, and compare angles/wide shots vs. cropped/dramatic frames.
Apply click restraint: Prefer “show additional posts”/more results over immediate judgment; avoid sensational headlines and ad-like items. (System reinforces this with Credibility↑ for scrolling; small Popularity↓ for time.)
Justify decisions with evidence: Mark specific items (sources/images) that support the final call; correct calls without evidence earn less—players must produce a verifiable trail.
Discriminate truth states: Correctly label tips as true, false, or misleading/halfs-true (e.g., real event + old footage), and select only current, authoritative evidence as support.
Recognise manipulation tactics: Identify miscaptioning, selective editing, synthetic composites, and emotionally charged wording as reliability risks.
Balance speed vs. accuracy: Understand (through meters/feedback) that verification builds Credibility while haste can boost Popularity but risks penalties for errors.
Transfer the routine: Consistently choose “Review” (image or text module) before publish/flag, then decide and explain briefly how the evidence leads to the conclusion.
Also please try to implement the following nudges for reflective thinking (perhaps voice over by the mentor), make the player think about five things:
Alternatives? I have formulated at least two plausible alternative explanations.

Counterevidence? I have actively looked for information that could falsify the claim.

Explanation? I can briefly explain how the evidence leads to the conclusion.

Norm? Here in the newsroom, it is standard practice to do this before publishing.

Accuracy? I am confident it is correct before sharing.

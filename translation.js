    introDescription:"Hej och välkommen till nyhetsstudion! Alla som är nya här på nyheterna får genomgå vår övning i att granska nyheter på sociala medier inför eventuell publicering. Vi vet sedan tidigare att många har problem med att vara sakliga och objektiva och därför kommer du att få chansen att testa och träna detta. Det är viktigt att dubbelkolla information innan den publiceras så att den är korrekt. Vi vill så klart snabbt komma ut med det senaste till våra läsare och tittare, men det får inte bli fel eftersom vårt rykte som nyhetskanal är superviktigt! \n" +
        "Några vanliga nybörjarfel är att man bara ser och hör det man vill och är van vid. Tolkar allt som stöd för det man redan tror på. Har problem att förklara sina bedömningar när någon frågar varför man tycker något. Inte är öppen för alternativa förklaringar. Bara letar efter bevis för det som man redan tycker – och struntar i det som motsäger detta. \n" +
        "Här jobbar vi aktivt med att bedöma informationen på ett sakligt och allsidigt sätt. Det handlar inte om att vara skeptisk till allt och alla utan att bedöma informationen på ett kritiskt och konstruktivt sätt. Detta handlar om att aktivt söka efter olika förklaringar, vara medveten om att man ofta fastnar i ett överdrivet självförtroende och hitta bra stöd i fakta för sina slutsatser. När vi publicerar något ska det vara läsvärt och korrekt, och vi måste veta att det är faktagranskade historier som vi för ut i samhället.   ",
